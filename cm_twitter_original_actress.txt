Become a superhero along with Brie Larson in new ‘Captain Marvel’ trailer (Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)  
After #InfinityWars and the end credits scene of #AntManandWasp I assume @captainmarvel will be 15 minutes of Brie Larson and 2 hours of Kevin Feige on camera flipping off all the fans. @MarvelStudios
In the Captain Marvel trailer, Brie Larson punches an elderly woman on a train! I sincerely doubt she's an advocate for that though! 
The fact that Brie Larson is casted as captain marvel <<<<<<<<<

Brie Larson was told to smile more as Captain Marvel and had the absolute best response https://ti.me/2zmC2I0
The bored, almost lifeless face Brie Larson makes in 99.9% of the Captain Marvel trailer is the same face I make in theaters at every cringe joke in MCU movies that the kids laugh at and grown Disney shills force themselves to laugh at.

Captain Marvel Actress Brie Larson Receives Backlash Over Instagram Tribute To Stan Lee 
People saying Brie Larson isn’t a good choice for Captain Marvel.   You know, just like how RDJ wasn’t a good choice for Iron Man. Or Evans as Captain America. Or Pratt as Star-Lord. Or Rudd as Scott Lang. Or Ruffalo as Hulk. Or Tom Holland as Spidey. How did all those pay off?
Captain Marvel's Brie Larson Wants to Make a Metroid Movie  
Watched the Captain Marvel trailer. Her voice seemed so bored and not commanding/strong at all. Her green costume looked uggo too.   I wish female actress would buff up a little for these roles. Her and Wonder Woman look like sticks. Where the thicc ladies at? 
If Brie Larson’s acting in the CAPTAIN MARVEL trailer is bad, then so is Ryan Gosling’s in BLADE RUNNER 2049.  #Biased
Brie Larson is an utter godsend and we do not deserve her talent. Captain Marvel will be what girls need everywhere and I can’t wait. 
Captain Marvel / Brie Larson 
Confession: I literally had no idea who is captain marvel (carol danvers) And I had no idea who was Brie Larson, the only time I found out about carol danvers existences And Brie existence is when captain marvel trailer dropped
i was hesitant with this but oh well what wouldn’t I do for my captain, I can’t wait to feel the empowerment, confidence and inspiration captain marvel and Brie will give us, this is for her and nishat only     love y’all with all my heart 
The MCU has found a new face of the franchise!  star Brie Larson is locked in for 7 movies in the MCU: 
"Brie Larson... I feel like I owe her child support. The acting chops of an Easter Island statue." - Ethan Van Sciver referring to Captain Marvel, 2018. @EthanVanSciver
just saw @brielarson's instagram story that said "omg cramps" just as i was also suffering, and realizing that my cycle might be synced up with @captainmarvel almost made me cry. it was quite possibly also the hormones.
Brie Larson Heard Complaints That  Needs to Smile More, So She Posted MCU Men With Photoshopped Smiles  
Brie Larson had the perfect answer for trolls complaining about  not smiling enough: 
I SWEAR TO GOD, I’m sick of guys who are mad that Brie Larson isn’t all smiles in Captain Marvel. SHES TRYING TO SAVE THE WORLD, she’s FOCUSED AND BADASS. This is worse than when some dude bro tells me to smile more.
Brie Larson Responded Perfectly to Jerks Who Said Captain Marvel Should Smile More. She reposting posters of the MCU’s male heroes on Instagram, "with their faces edited into smiles that look horrible because of course they would." 
I'm also acknowledging Brie Larson for playing the MCU's first female solo title role in Captain Marvel.

why are people still so upset about brie's acting in the captain marvel trailer? will y'all ever hold the chrises to the same standard because last time i checked they weren't known for their award worthy performances
First Brie Larson got cast as Captain Marvel. Now Mary Elizabeth Winstead. All my Scott Pilgrim boo are becoming superheros  
some shots of brie from the captain marvel reshoots! 
Nick Fury is the one who calls Captain Marvel at the end of Infinity War. It’s very obvious why the trailer was done the way it was.  Brie Larson has said 33 words, but Melissa McEwan should say 0. 
Brie Larson was told Captain Marvel should “smile more,” so she posted photoshopped pics of male superheroes smiling  
Brie Larson as  is the best thing I've ever seen this year and the next.

Brie Larson suit up as Captain Marvel during ET Interview.   
he was captain marvel before but not anymore, there's only one captain marvel and her name is carol danvers, brie larson gets paid to be "moody" also she promotes something called equal rights for women and yes men are in fact weak 
People in the comments of this post also said she’d  be a better Captain Marvel.... SCARLETt isn’t the only actress alive you fuckin plebs and y’all act like she’s above every other mcu actress when she has the acting range of a string bean 
Okay. Here me out.  Chris Evans and Brie Larson are both in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.  Chris plays Captain America. Brie plays Captain Marvel.  What are the chances that they meet in Avengers 4 and slip in a Scott Pilgrim reference?  Yeah, too much to think on that.

I wanna see you all wearing something #CaptainMarvel on the premiere! You have to take a pic and tag me and Brie. You have around 5 months! GO!
Happy Birthday to @BireLarson ,We're waiting for you,  
Lmaoooo Brie Larson is trash imma boycott Captain Marvel
Update: brie Larson posted these on her Instagram story. I just want you to know I’m so blessed to now be one degree removed from captain marvel.
It’s the FIRST trailer and most of the MCU fans know next to nothing about Captain Marvel. And NONE of us know anything about that actress or her spin on the character.  It makes perfect sense to have an established character to narrate the trailer
YES! CAPTAIN MARVEL Star Brie Larson Has Signed Up To Star In SEVEN Marvel Cinematic Universe Movies     
The planet Hala, home of the Kree alien race, is briefly shown in the new  trailer: 
bc Captain Marvel got announced in ‘14, Brie Larson was cast in ‘16 and they started production when her schedule cleared after her ‘17 films like Kong and her 1st directorial debut film. This was coming. I’d say BW got greenlit after WW success but CM was greenlit since ‘14 
it took a month for them to get here and then another month for the weather to cooperate but omg I love them I have never felt more powerful   praise to our lord and savior brie larson   
brie larson stans attacking david sandberg for saying facts. y'all petty af. shazam is in fact the original captain marvel. go see shazam in theaters april 5th, 2019.

Why can’t y’all just leave well enough alone?   Let Brie Larson be and let fans have our moment with    Gtfoh with this shit fam. 
“why isn’t brie/carol smiling on the captain marvel poster?” ....... 
just love how dudebros praised sebastian stan’s blank-face acting in tws (which was there for a reason) yet criticise brie larson for the same thing in the captain marvel trailer despite there being a very similar reason for their facial expressions
Captain Marvel's Brie Larson Dressed Up As Samus Aran For Halloween 
y’all I have not spoken up for WEEKS about this but every time I see a captain marvel ad with Brie Larson on it I’ve been like “that’s not Brie fuckin Larson but ok!!!” because everyone agrees it’s Brie Larson?! just realized I was thinking of Allison Brie this entire time.
Take a closer look at the '90s nostalgia, digital de-aged Nick Fury and @brielarson action at the center of the #CaptainMarvel trailer http://thr.cm/xQagCP
“brie larson showed no emotion during the captain marvel trailer !!!11! she’s gonna be awful!!1!1” nah maybe a) it’s a 2 minute trailer which showed hardly anything and b) brie was shown for like seconds at a time in scenes w no context. shut the fuck up& wait for the film maybe? 
Can't wait to see  #CaptainMarvel with u @brielarson next year
Thought this was Brie Larson gearing up for her Captain Marvel role

CAPTAIN MARVEL Star Brie Larson Has Signed on For Seven Marvel Films  
I don't really like #captainMarvel  Firstly coz i m not fond of thr character secondly i don't feel connected to the actress playing it  Thirdly and most importantly bitch is getting a movie before #BlackWidow  Widow was there all the time she deserved it before her
can’t believe yall have the guts to say with ur whole chest that captain marvel is the greatest character brie larson has played ... have y’all forgotten that she was a SIX CHICK  
Yeah it is a mistake because assuming all heroes were white men would mean you woukd have to ignore decades of mass media. I'm sure Brie Larson would like to pretend that Captain Marvel was never a black woman
I've decided that, while I'm still totally supporting #RehireJamesGunn and think that @RobertIger and #Horn should step down immediately for caving to Nazis - I'm not going to screw over @brielarson and @captainmarvel Those attacking @Disney @starwars and @Marvel want failure.
 i've been waiting for a captain marvel movie since i was 13 years old (im almost 20) and we FINISHED got one! brie was born to play this role! and i'm so glad marvel found a captain marvel who's a superhero on and off screen. she fights for women and i love her sm 
this film is going to blow ppl away, the haters can just hate, Brie Larson is going to amaze us as Captain Marvel 
Brie Larson. Captain Marvel. Marvel. Hayley Atwell. Comics. 
Desperate MCU fanboys trying to make Captain Brie relevant by claiming Wonder Woman 1984 moved to June 2020 because it's "running scared" from 'Marvel Studios' Captain Marvel' which would've released EIGHT MONTHS before WW84.... ? That's cute.

if there’s one thing i want stan twitter to learn, it’s that the past tense of “cast” is “cast.”  as in, “brie larson was cast as captain marvel.”  NOT “CASTED.” 
 voice actress too 
#HappyBirthdayBrie She has captured the hearts of fans like #CaptainMarvel
From Brie Larson’s IG!! “Thank you to the military families, STEM students and all the other cuties who came to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum to see the  trailer in IMAX. Amazed that anyone would want to see my face that large.” - WE ALL WILL!

These folks are TRULY IRRITATED at the fact Brie Larson didn’t smile...sorry “show emotions” in the  trailer.   All they did was post pics of Mysterio from the new Spidey flick. Stay pressed. 
What if Captain Marvel is just a fantasy playing out in Brie Larson’s head while she’s stuck in Room
Absolutely, there’s room for all “Good” movies. How amazing will Kristen Wiig be as Cheetah? I also look forward to Brie Larson’s portrayal as Captain Marvel. 
I’m excited for Captain Marvel but I’m afraid that Brie Larson ends up phoning it in i hope I’m wrong 
You’re the most devoted Captain Marvel fan I’ve ever seen on twitter, I think you going to meet Brie Larson would be amazing since you know everything there is to know about Carol Danvers and you’re very passionate about the CM movie and represent the Carol Corps!!
Hey  ... anything you can do to help the biggest  fan and  fan I Know in  ! He’s the leader of the  and it would so awesome for him to meet Brie.  anything you can do to help?
Brie Larsen as Captain Marvel looks terrible, she has Soccer Mom Bitch Face the whole time. When I look at promo video/photos I am like “is this a CW show?”  I want to see it because of the connected universe and interesting story, but so far idk about this casting.

Fuuuuuck me. Brie Larson doesn't want some rando's digits, and that's reason to not go see "Captain Marvel?" I'd expect no less from a fragile nitwit who counts Nazi apologists among his friends.
I don’t care if you don’t think  will be a good carol danvers. I don’t care if you don’t think girls need a hero w a stand alone film. I don’t care if you think captain marvel is overpowered and boring.  Brie Larson is a hero. And no one can ever convince me otherwise.

Brie Larson delivers perfect response to sexist criticisms of the  trailer 
Random and slightly off-topic observation: The Venn diagram of "people who think @brielarson should smile more as Captain Marvel" and "people who think Hillary Clinton's smile is so fake" is just a circle, right? #KavaNOPE

#CaptainMarvel wants to be Samus? Musta seen dat trailer of #SmashBrosUltimate. Gotta wait until her movie to see if the quality of this Brie is bold enough to be from Wisconsin. Even though the character is from Boston. But then again, this Brie has been aged for over 20 years!

LRT: she really counted the words in a trailer and the film is STARRING Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, the name of the damn movie...  I just...how is it possible to be THAT insufferable. Oh wait, that’s right. 
Google has failed me. I thought I had all the pictures of Brie Larson on set of Captain Marvel and I don’t.

I’ve seen a lot of criticism towards Brie Larson/Captain Marvel. We saw a two minute trailer. Two minutes, guys. We don’t know what internal battles her character is fighting, etc. I can’t think of too many heroes who are all rainbows & sunshine when discovering who they are. 
it’ll be bitter sweet to see the @TheRealStanLee cameo in @captainmarvel  #StanLee @Marvel @brielarson #CaptainMarvel #CarolDanvers
brie continues to inspire everyday, she really is our captain marvel 
Brie Larson isn't here for your sexist  backlash. The Oscar winner responded to complains her superhero needs to "smile more" by posting photoshopped photos of Iron Man, Captain America, and more smiling.  
Somehow the #DarkPhoenix trailer, though not perfect, makes the #CaptainMarvel trailer look like a cement colored generic film... & it didn't show anything at all! CM trailer was weighed down by terrible cgi, the bored expression from Larson, & somehow Nick Fury having more lines
Can’t wait for @brielarson to kill it as captain marvel!!
Did you dislike the #CaptainMarvel trailer? Good for you! You’re entitled to your own opinion! Did you bully actresses like @brielarson just because you didn’t like their performance in a 1.5 minute trailer?   Rethink your choices.
You can be you. That means you can smile or not! BOOM   via  http://time.com/5403533/brie-larson-captain-marvel-smile/?xid=tcoshare … #WomenKickAss #CaptainMarvel @captainmarvel
