Its been years can yall stop pulling this card. Doctor who,Star Wars,Wonder woman,Batwoman,Supergirl, Hunger Games,Annihilation,Captain Marvel,Halloween.  White women are dominating hollywood stop using some trolls as an excuse for your film.

"Captain Marvel on spoke 33 words" lady and "superheroes shouldn't punch old ladies" woman... are they the same person or Pokemon evolutions of each other? Inquiring minds...
Brie Larson calls role as 1st ever solo female superhero 'surreal'  WONDER WOMAN CAME OUT LAST YEAR!!!    
Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, Christine Blasey Ford. Sometimes the most heroic thing you can do is just step forward and speak your truth.
Why can't people be happy that Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel both have movies and not shit on either or for bad and lazy reasons? Lol
 the future is female and brie larson is our leader (bonus: me crying over the captain marvel trailer) 
Whats with all this Captain Marvel hate? You can compliment Wonder Woman without putting Captain Marvel down. Can you at least wait till you watch the movie and then give your opinion. Y’all are giving DC stans a bad name. 
I'm with @GeeksGamersCom Gonna Skip #CaptainMarvel I won't support a NPC actor  I wait for the beautiful Gal Wonder Woman she passionate, Strong and a actor that loves her Role & Fan's   Link https://youtu.be/nuliL_D2Y_Y
I like all superheroes. But I tend to grativiate more to the women ones. Like Squirrel Girl, Captain Marvel, Supergirl, and Black Widow. The list goes on. :) 
marvel nerds were so mad that Thor: Ragnarok was a lighter movie with humor & not so serious unlike its preceding movies but now y’all are mad that Captain Marvel, a woman, isn’t smiling 100% of the time in a movie that’s supposed to b dark n serious? SHUT UP
This is the tale of how one of the worst stories of all time helped influence the direction of  for many years while also leading to a rise of women in criticism and fandom.  
What gets me about this whole "Captain Marvel has to smile" ridiculousness is that I don't think anyone did this kind of stuff with Wonder Woman.   It's not like her trailers and posters were all smiley.
Very excited to finally see a strong female lead in the MCU! Also still upset over @Disney firing @JamesGunn. #CaptainMarvel has served with the @Guardians. @Disney #RehireJamesGunn and give us the team-up we deserve!  @WaltDisneyCo @RobertIger @Kevfeigehttps://www.change.org/p/marvel-re-hire-james-gunn …
I'm convinced Disney put the "Captain Marvel punches an old woman in the face" scene into the trailer specifically because they knew it would turn into a meme
Why Brie Larson Punches an Elderly Woman in First 'Captain Marvel' Trailer 
What's with the collective amnesia surrounding reporting on these? Some big outlet said yesterday that Captain Marvel was going to be the first woman led movie when Wonder Woman came out all of 15 months ago.  and then Black Panther and Blade
I can't wait for my little cousin to start watching marvel movies and be inspired and empowered by the female heros  captain marvel is going to be a big leap

Women’s presence in the superhero genre will continue to grow as studios find success with female-led movies like  and , say box office analysts:   
If you're going to play the idiotic game of Captain Marvel vs. Wonder Woman 1984, at least have the spine to admit that now Wonder Woman 1984 has an even better chance at a billion in June 2020 by itself than Captain Marvel does in March 2019 a month before Shazam.
Girls don’t want boys they want the Captain Marvel movie and better funding, media coverage, and access to women’s soccer so awards voters can make informed decisions
However, I want to bring special attention to people pitting Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel against each other. Just like those that pitted Supergirl against Jessica Jones, you're being part of the problem. There can more than one superheroine. You're not helping. Stop it. 
Kids (really) want more women in sci-fi, superhero genres, study says   
Happy birthday to Brie Larson, a beautiful and talented woman, our powerful Captain Marvel.  
Sam!Cap Jane!Thor Captain Marvel Spider-Woman The Wasp Black Panther Iron Man 
Stan wasn’t problematic all the claims are false if he was sexist why would he make black widow or captain marvel hell there’s even aus where there’s female versions of the characters for God’s sake that he created
I'm so behind this. Marvel really need to take a serious look at their gender balance, 1 female lead to 3 male leads on Netflix? Not to mention the MCU being a total sausage fest. Can't wait for Captain Marvel but it's seriously late in the day. 
2019 looks set to be another Superhero dominated box office offering, however it’s all going to be fronted by strong ass female leads.    
The answer to this is, we can & we will. I think studios used to believe that female lead superheroes were not really marketable, possibly due to popularity. But Wonder Woman shattered that belief & there are many more: Captain Marvel, Supergirl, Jean Grey, Batgirl, Zatanna e.t.c 
This fierce fan edit gives us the , , and female superhero team-up we desperately need:  
Today's Captain Marvel issue brings an important message to readers.  Marvel cant write women and think Carol Danvers isnt worth their time
I just looked down and realized I’m wearing my Captain Marvel shirt under my DC Superwomen blazer and I would be annoyed by the mismatch, but I’ve decided it just gives me double the power.
ABC: Brie Larson stars as the first-ever solo female superhero in Captain Marvel...  Me: 
I want Our   to lead Female Avengers Movie after  i hope this happen 
The first woman in history to be the lead in a Disney acquired Marvel movie set in the MCU about Captain Marvel. Never run out of firsts please, it always makes me laugh. 
I actually like diversity in my stories, I’m old enough to remember when Captain Marvel was a black woman. The problem  has now in particular is they have completely broken fans affinity to characters and stories, and tossed in a Trump-NAZIs as a parting gift.
Only Real Comic Book fans know that Captain Marvel vs Wonder Woman is debatable. And in some cases Captain Marvel will win.
She usually has good takes. This isn’t one of them. Not because it’s historically inaccurate but because it ignores the wave that’s happening with Wonder Woman, captain marvel, birds of prey and New Gods which looks like a Big Barda showcase. 
I’ve just been reminded that  will be released on International Women’s Day  
Today I’m going to class because one day I want to own the house that every Batgirl, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, Jedi, princess and mini RBG go to for the good (aka king size) candy bars. #HappyHalloween

One thing I’ve never completely gotten about Carol/Captain Marvel is that for most of her comic life she’s been a fairly unlikeable character. Not because she’s a powerful, confident woman... but well, sort of because of the opposite of that. /1 
In the Captain Marvel trailer, Brie Larson punches an elderly woman on a train! I sincerely doubt she's an advocate for that though! 
Captain Marvel:  V: She looks like that type of woman who loves gay men but is weirded out by lesbians.  Me: Seriously?  V: Yeah, look at her. You know brunches with gay dudes but makes snippy remarks about the lesbian server.  Me: There is no evidence to support that.   V:

I love that they're make Captain Marvel a woman and retconning women into roles where they fit is a great idea, but more new female and LGBTQ superheros will be better in the long run

I’m worried .. if Captain America hands over his duties to Captain Marvel, were gonna get a lot of toxic fanboys hating Captain Marvel even more and opening a floodgate of anti-women heroes because this would be their scapegoat reasoning for their antifeminist bs. Shit man.
happy birthday to the beautiful, talented brie larson. our one and only captain marvel  thank you for inspiring women around the world to find the superhero in them and empowering them to be the best versions of themselves that they can be.   
...what's similar about them? Comic book based. Female leads... Space. What, is there a lot of fire in Captain Marvel or something?
captain marvel: h- misogynists: how dare a movie be about a powerful woman NO WOMAN IS ALLOWED TO BE MORE POWERFUL THAN A MAN!!!!!!!!! FUCK YOU I HOPE THANOS EATS YOU, YOU DUMB WOMAN!!!!!
I knew it was just about Captain Marvel’s tits!  After months of unnecessary fuckery it’s finally accepted  comicsgate is simply about female characters guys can jerk off too  Well that’s sorted then. 
that captain marvel mood is one many women know. she doesnt have to smile and she doesn't even have to look badass. she just looks DONE.
So if I’m counting right. We will have 8 CBMs next year? Dark Phoenix, New Mutants, Captain Marvel, Shazam, Avengers, Spiderman, Joker, and Wonder Woman 1984
Watched the Captain Marvel trailer. Her voice seemed so bored and not commanding/strong at all. Her green costume looked uggo too.   I wish female actress would buff up a little for these roles. Her and Wonder Woman look like sticks. Where the thicc ladies at? 
Tapos ung counterpart ni Superman sa Marvel which is Captain Marvel sinave talaga nila for last na like when even the Avengers failed na haha also she’s a woman
2019 is going to be crazy year for movies  - Captain Marvel - Joker - Aladdin - Avengers 4 - The Lion King  - Wonder Woman 1984 - Spider-Man: Far From Home - Frozen 2 - Toy Story 4  - & of course, Star Wars Episode IX to top it all off 
obviously there are crackheads who would make ww being pushed back about captain marvel. y'all petty asf. y'all so threatened by wonder woman that much? HER IMPACT UGH!!!
Top 10 female Marvel characters more interesting than Captain Marvel and Jean Grey:  1. Rogue  2. White Queen 3. Psylocke 4. Mystique 5. She-Hulk 6. Storm 7. Gamora 8. Tigra 9. Lilith 10. Domino
YT women when Captain Marvel doesn't break 1 billion like that Nigger Cat movie did: 
why don’t we love wonder woman AND captain marvel
Captain Marvel is going to be a very important movie, apart from being a movie with heroin, it will exploit women in a profession that is dominated by men. We've never seen women being portrayed this way in the movies. This is a good time to live.  
Thats our ! A smart and strong woman. It’s so inspiring to see how  is feeling empowered, fierce and ripped! PROUD!  “A strong woman is a woman determined to do something others are determined not to be done.” Marge Piercy
When WW showed up in BVS people got excited because they saw a character who they’ve loved for a while come to the big screen. Captain Marvel has never resonated with audiences and the only reason she has fans now is cause she’s a strong woman in a marvel movie. 
Wonder woman. Black widow. Shuri. Gamora. The wasp. Captain marvel. Jean grey. Scarlett witch. Invisible woman. Valkyrie. Elektra. Storm. Mystique. Star fire. Black canary. Hawk girl. Mera. Bat woman. Zatanna. Katana. Etc. Perhaps Women should support heroines by buying comics. 
MCU fans can't fathom an actual well-thought out story because they think the MCU is the Gold Standard  The MCU, who has TWO MOVIES that were knee jerk reactions to DCEU (Civil War which was BvS watered down and Captain Marvel which is Wonder Woman if it was a dumb idea)
Twitter feminists ranted about Captain Marvel not talking much in the movie trailer but no word was spoken for Yazidi Survivor Nadia Murad winning a Peace Nobel Prize huh
This is really great . Lexi is the first woman to direct a Marvel adaptation & 9yrs later, when the article was published (2017), was still the ONLY woman. Anna Boden’s Captain Marvel and Gina Prince-Bythewood’s Silver and Black are coming soon! This is a GREAT read. 
I'm also acknowledging Brie Larson for playing the MCU's first female solo title role in Captain Marvel. 
Fascinating (although, dissapointing) insight. I wonder how many films directed by women are planned for 2019? Wonder Woman was recently pushed back, but there's still Captain Marvel, Little Women, Frozen 2 and Charlie's Angels.
Happy birthday to ! We're so excited for 'Captain Marvel' that we could punch an old woman* on the bus!   *If that old woman were actually some kind of invading alien in disguise of course 
Who else is excited to finaly see a MCU female lead female super hero film?! #CaptainMarvel Can't wait!
As a kid I always thought Wonder Woman should be stronger than Superman, though she was never depicted that way. My logic was, Diana (at least in the Bronze Age) was stronger than Hercules. Captain Marvel had the strength of Hercules and was evenly matched with Superman, sooo...

Not sure what made me laugh more: the idea of #WW84 "rebooting" the DCEU or Wonder Woman 84 moving out of 2019 because of Captain Marvel?
he was captain marvel before but not anymore, there's only one captain marvel and her name is carol danvers, brie larson gets paid to be "moody" also she promotes something called equal rights for women and yes men are in fact weak

in my opinion...  wonder woman > captain marvel
Remember when The Wasp created the Avengers or when Monica Rambeau was the first black woman to lead the Avengers (and the 1st female Captain Marvel) ? Marvel robbed us, yet white women prefer to complain about the number of words Nick Fury says in the Captain Marvel trailer.

Oh shit! Then it's not even a fight it's gonna be a beat down. Wonder Woman and Super Girl with fuck Captain Marvel and Jean Grey the fuck up.
Woot woot! Super women!  
Maybe because men were considered superior and they believe male superheroes will help gain more widely recognizable. We now have Captain Marvel, Wonder woman and so on
My new favorite subgenre of Facebook comment is people who haven’t read a Marvel comic since 1980 suddenly becoming VERY concerned that Captain Marvel is a woman 
Take Catwoman for example, she's a solid character (anti-hero) & her standalone movie would have been great, but the script and maybe acting was a bit off. Personally though, I think she deserves a 2nd chance. That's why I'm happy with the Captain Marvel movie. Another female
For the first time in my life i can't wait for women's day  
COME THRU CAPTAIN MARVEL! They truly handled what’s got to be the scariest work incident of my life. I NEED names because I NEED to thank these wonderful women in person.   Hey  your kind heart is showing...and it’s beautiful.
Between this, Captain Marvel, Black Widow and Bumblebee, it might just be a good year or so for female led action movies.

I 100% agree. I strongly believe some MCU fans need the same wake-up call though. We all just want the same thing and not one side is better than the other. The Captain Marvel trailer was filled with comments about how it was gonna kill Wonder Woman. Why can't we have both?

Why did MCU wait until Wonder Woman’s success to move forward with Captain Marvel, why did MCU do CW as a response to BvS instead of following through with Cap’s actual sequel, why are all of these female led projects being announced by MCU after DC did it before them?  
Sorry folks, I know it’s a cool narrative to push that Marvel hates women and waited a long time for Captain Marvel, but these two shows are actually a thing.

I’m glad the little Madster is growing up in an era where her first princesses were Elsa & Anna, her first hero was Wonder Woman, she’s loving the new female doctor but she can also dress up as princess poppy from  trolls & a stormtrooper at the same time.

Captain Marvel. She-Hulk. Black Widow. Scarlet Witch. Medusa. Spider Woman. Mockingbird. 
Yeah it is a mistake because assuming all heroes were white men would mean you woukd have to ignore decades of mass media. I'm sure Brie Larson would like to pretend that Captain Marvel was never a black woman
People are afraid of horrendously shitty movies. As surprising as this'll be Melissa McCarthy is not the singular representation of women in entertainment and media.  I'd imagine  is going to do pretty well.

This three has more personality and character development than all of MCU's female characters combined. and they are no sidekicks or just love interests. But sure, Captain Marvel will revolutionize the female superhero films, lol. 
This is the tale of how one of the worst stories of all time helped influence the direction of  for many years while also leading in a rise of women in criticism and fandom. 
My next cosplay after MCM is done will be with the red, blue and gold Captain Marvel costume then after that hopefully I can cosplay my favourite MCU characters, Hope Van Dyne and Valkyrie (in her outfit that the Valkyries wore)! Such badass and empowering women and costumes! 
Wasn't sure which female superhero to put against Captain Marvel. Thought about Batgirl, Batwoman, Black Canary, Starfire, Hawkgirl, Catwoman -- literally everyone. But settled on DC's high-flying, super powered blond heroine in order to keep in the theme of mirroring Marvel.

Watch the trailer for Marvel’s first female-led superhero flick, Captain Marvel:

In the theater after the Captain Marvel trailer the twink sitting next to me whispered 'Captain Marvel is a woman????'
Cap Neptune in 7H and be all means PLEASE get me in on a Wonder Woman movie or Captain Marvel   Or anything with Jason Momoa so I can meet the man of my dreams 
In all honesty tho, wonder woman and captain marvel give me so much more confidence in myself
I remember sobbing watching WW & not knowing why ‘til I spoke to other women who’d felt the same thing: representation, elevation, hope.  I feel it again watching the #CaptainMarvel trailer.  These films are important & I cannot wait to see @brielarson bring it to the big screen.
I love this woman so much. She’s using her position to do great things. I can’t wait to see  
Captain Marvel Captain Marvel Wonder Woman Wonder Man Power Girl Powers Boothe Skeets 
On the one hand: waits for heckin    On the other hand: WHY should I HAVE to wait for heckin ?  Fuck it! WHY should I have 2 wait 2 whole years between kickass female hero movies?  Men bloody well don’t  *riots*  *pays for the damage*   
I don’t apologize for asking the top general in the Air Force about a movie about an Air Force fighter pilot. Dudes can be pumped for Captain Marvel too. This isn’t a movie for women, it’s a movie starring a woman for general audiences.

I tell you about this men they complaining  Brie Larson is not smiling in the Captain Marvel trailer .. men also constantly  complained  Hillary Clinton did not smile or her laugh was devilish .. for this men women has to behave the way men wants them .. guess what fuck y'all 
#DarkPhoenix #CaptainMarvel #Wonderwoman can you say another white hero movie. #Yawn All the heroes are white blah blah yada yada ya. that captain marvel trailer sucks.
“What!? No! We can't beat up woman! That's Captain Marvel's job!  You know, she beat an Old woman? ”  Smh. 
Some men have a peculiar need to tell women to smile. It’s annoying sexist crap and even female superheroes have to deal with it  Brie Larson Was Told to Smile More As Captain Marvel. She Had the Absolute Best Response. - TIMEhttps://apple.news/AXqpwEngfQ06ezViIf074_Q
There's the Characters I want: Marvel - Captain Marvel  DC - Cassandra Cain (Batgirl)  The characters they'll most likely do: Marvel - Iron Man/Thor/Captain America  DC - Wonder Woman
imagine if Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman And Birds of Prey all game out in the same year. They’d all be big af.
Speaking of female singers I just found out that Brie Larson who plays Captain Marvel was a singer!   Check it out:  https://youtu.be/-bvYRlv7XCw
I’m curious of what you think of this match up: Captain Marvel/Shazam versus Wonder Woman. I’m still going Wonder Woman, but I think it’ll be a tougher fight for her. 
@brielarson I hope Captain Marvel ugly cries like the rest of the women trying to fix the world!
The  trailer has now made over 1.5X what the 1st Wonder Woman trailer and 2.78X what the 1st Ant-Man and the Wasp trailer did on YouTube. Yeah, people can assume Ant-Man 2 numbers for Captain Marvel, but, I remain confident it can pull a  and do $1BWW.
1. Please include a bathroom break intermission or that's just mean to post-maternity women 2. Head's up, I'm gonna need about 2.5 of those hours to be Captain Marvel 
I agree with Jahns here. People do not know who Captain Marvel is like they do Wonder Woman which is why I hate the "19 male led movies" argument and Marvel needed to hook us more than just "here's our big female hero!"  https://youtu.be/fENba3XhxUg
Meta de amizade: Captain Marvel e Spider-Woman  
Got it, this old woman is the face of old Britain voting for Brexit and Captain Marvel the young intelligent saying wtf.  ?
The men complaining about Captain Marvel’s “expressionless” face are the same assholes who invade a woman’s personal space to tell them to smile 
Like , there are a lot of heroic female fighter pilots in real life, too! 
i love that captain marvel is a thing because now marvel is actually gonna have to make toys/merch of a woman
hmm, people are upset bc captain marvel didn’t smile in the trailer,, but they are mad bc thor was a happy movie? that kinda reminds me of those guys on the streets. ya know, those guys that tell everyone woman they see to smile?? what a coincidence
The Woman that Empowers Women and stole mens hearts around the world. But The Captain Marvel chick is....meh  
ive seen the captain marvel trailer twice and cried twice. im an extremely simple woman.
Kamala Khan.   Captain Marvel is my ultimate feminist icon, and Squirrel Girl is just more fun and emphasizes alternate ways of defeating foes.  But Kamala has replaced Peter as the ultimate geek icon.
Fellas I get it. We’ve been programmed since birth desiring to live in a world where pretty girls smile at us. It makes us feel good. However each us should challenge that. We have to reprogram ourselves to let women be who they want to be- not wish fulfillment  
They are a peaceful people, but I am a woman of war. If you move against them,you move against me. I am willing to die here today, for this cause. I have made my choice... Now you make yours.       ♡
Captain America (leader) Captain Marvel (co-leader) Spider-Woman (stealth, surveillance) She-Hulk (heavy hitter) Spectrum (energy, synergistic) Blue Marvel (science / tech / heavy hitter) Ms. Marvel (being groomed as next gen leader)  (Ignore the fact that there's three Marvels) 
Ever think the reason women don't consume comics is because of lack of female superheroes to look up to? Notice how Black people got excited for BP? Notice how women got excited for Captain Marvel? Notice how many thinkpieces et al it has gotten? 
in this house we respect and love wonder woman AND captain marvel, two strong and independent female superhero leads who finally get their own trilogy instead of pitting them against each other every chance we get

captain marvel makes me feel strong and powerful and proud to be a woman that’s why i love her so much  
Compare that with the trailer for Captain Marvel ... Which, I mean, isn't bad, but is so satisfied with itself. WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE "HERO" FADE INTO A "HER". Even though, y'know, it's like the twentieth of their movies and the only one to have a female lead and director ...
Captain Marvel should smile! She immediately punches an old woman for smiling.

‘Captain Marvel’ Composer Breaks Superhero Glass Ceiling as Scoring Diversity Lags. In the past 11 years and out of 1,100 films, only 1.3% of composers were female. Pinar Toprak is the first woman to score a high-profile Marvel movie.   
In 2019 im definitely Going to say this #RIP my Pocket Money..   Because of them..!!   Captain Marvel Spiderman Far from home Avengers 4 Joker Wonder Woman 2 X-men Dark Phoenix Shazam  The new Mutant Hellboy
I promise I’m gonna see Captain Marvel but in all honesty, it looks like Captain America: First Avenger only a woman and in the 90s with young Sam Jackson. I’m excited for Captain Marvel but more because of the tie-in to Avengers 4 more so than the actual character.
"She’s just not demonstrating the three expressions they care to look for in a woman - namely, expressions that show she’s soft, feminine and interested in their opinions. Because she’s not. She’s Captain Marvel, motherfuckers, and she’s got shit to do."@brielarson #captainmarvel
I just found out that the first captain marvel was a black woman named Monica Rambeau who lost her name to a white man who then gave the name to a white woman .  
Just had a interesting chat about international woman’s day  (Because of captain marvel) and got asked if there was a international men’s day so I looked it up.  I didn’t know this, so  so that people know.
i say this because im talking to my friend about captain marvel rn and he keeps saying how happy he is that marvel opened doors to women protagonists. i stan him 
People are mad online because in the trailer for the female led, female written and directed movie "Captain Marvel", the male narrator says exactly 34 more words than not the narrator  
So, the person who edited the Captain Marvel trailer to make her smile more also has countless tweets saying men need to step up and "take women's rights away" because "women are only as bad as men allow them to be" and ... also says they're a lesbian trans woman?
Which do you consider to be the best female superhero? — captain marvel. even if i don’t know her. i know it. I CAN FEEL IT. https://curiouscat.me/cinnamon_hope/post/694238290?1541030531 …
to clear this up. my tweets were directed at the really extreme tweets that were literally acting like captain marvel is the first female hero to ever be introduced. not the ones about her being the first solo mcu female lead bc that is incredible and does deserve so much hype.
Oh.   Dawn of Justice - Civil War Wonder woman - Captain Marvel New gods - Eternals Aquaman - Namor Birds of Prey - an all female movie 
Next year:  • #GameOfThrones S8 • #StrangerThings S3 • #CaptainMarvel  • #InfinityWar part 2 • #DarkPhoenix  • #WonderWoman1984  • #JessicaJones S3  All the good things next year

I just realized Captain Marvel/Shazam’s costume is right in the front, in front of Wonder Woman’s. 
How many series does Marvel have (currently running or solicited already) that are solo female-led?  Shuri Ironheart Black Widow X-23 Captain Marvel / Life of Captain Marvel Jessica Jones Ms. Marvel Squirrel Girl Domino Spider-Gwen Moon Girl & Devil Dino Unstoppable Wasp

I like this assumption that Disney is inciting violence against the elderly.   Notes: headline implies Zoe thinks it's ok for male supers to punch old ladies.  "The new female captain Marvel" implies she knows there's a male one. Superman ref. Does she think they replaced Batson. 
next year is going to be THE YEAR. I mean, Game of Thrones s8 Stranger things s3 Avengers Annihilation Spiderman : far from home IT 2 Star wars 9 Wonder woman 2 Captain Marvel Godzilla 2  2019 is going to be AMAZING
y’all protesting captain marvel? tbh good luck if y’all want a representative marvel movie again. marvel barely gave a straight white woman who own movie. if it flops, it’s back to fuckin iron man 77.
...Then  is an example of what happens when women take all that crap absorbed and turn it into the kinetic energy of incandescent rage. 
SuperGirl.  HawkGirl.  Captain Marvel  Wonder Woman  Storm  Jean Grey  Hera  Mystique  White Tiger  Thundra  Sersei  Black Widow  Infact i can go on and on, and educate u.. But u seem set in your foolishness, so continue to play in the dirt of ur ignorance 
Listen imma say this once: I do not want Captain Marvel to have a love interest at all. Can she please be an independent fierce single woman? I need it pleathe
Catwoman, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman are my favorites, right now.

Richard Meyer’s critique of Captain Marvel summed up (echoed in )  -There is a woman in it.  I get it. Literally every member of the opposite sex runs away from the guy (unless he is wearing a red tie). So he is projecting his prejudice.
It's fascinating watching the difference in reactions to Carol Danvers Captain Marvel (and other Strong Female CharactersTM) and Bowsette. The Captain Marvel books consistently fail to sell well, despite a massive and constant media push that THIS IS PROGRESS. /1
HAPPY 9th BIRTHDAY to Anna, who is already one of the most powerful women I’ve ever known. Like, seriously y’all; the world ain’t ready.  I’m SO proud to be her dad.     
captain marvel will outgross Wonder woman AND gets better scores 
This was pretty much expected in my mind.  The MCU is a super successful brand with a lot of consumer goodwill and a massive fanbase, it's also the first female superhero solo in the MCU, and yes I think the name Captain Marvel naturally helps market it as a Marvel property.
Great cover!!! Wonder Woman looks ultra ultimate BADASS with this full weaponized suit!!!! And damn, what a trio: Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman and Superman. Reminds me of the classic Justice Society power trio, Spectre, Doctor Fate and the flaming Green Lanter. Unstoppable!!! 
thinking about how im excited for captain marvel and ww84 omg i love two powerful women

Disney's Marvel Studios is set to introduce Captain Marvel, it's first female superhero lead, starring actress Brie Larson. The character is being described as being 'more powerful' than any other superhero introduced so far by Marvel. https://buff.ly/2zp2m4j
I have to disagree. Some of the oldest and strongest comic book heros are women; Storm, Lady Luck, Black widow ( frm the 40s) , Miss fury,Dagger,Spider-girl, Cat woman, Bat girl, Captain Marvel, Jean Grey... comic book writers been inclusive,  some sexist (stories)but inclusive. 
History in the making:  is starring in , making her the first woman to lead a Marvel superhero movie 
A gear idea for  inspired by Captain Marvel. Since a ton of ladies started to make gears inspired by WW. for women's empowerment. Why not add Captain Marvel into the mix?  
2019 is going to be better. Already scheduled with more hopefully to come:  Miss Bala Frozen 2 The Rhythm Section Captain Marvel The Sun Is Also a Star The Kitchen Charlie’s Angels Queen & Slim Little Women 
Blue Beetle and Booster Gold.  Captain Marvel and Spider-Woman.  Jessica Cruz and Simon Baz.  Green Arrow and Hal. 
Who do you think is the best female superhero? — captain marvel or jessica jones https://curiouscat.me/regalevans/post/710381418?t=1542672173 …
I need set videos, photos, and promotional pictures from: Daredevil season 3, Aquaman, Avengers 4 (lol good luck), X-Men Dark Phoenix, and maybe whatever else you guys might think would work.   So far I've already got Captain Marvel, Spider-Man FFH, WonderWoman, and Joker.

Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman 1984 release delayed, Captain Marvel is the only solo female superhero film of 2019  
Funny how when a woman who looks like that tends to show up in a book is shamed like what they did in Captain Marvel when Carl looked at what she used to look like and scoffed.
it's funny that male marvel fans accuse women of liking marvel because we find the heroes hot yet here they are upset that captain marvel isn't smiling in the trailer, like that even has anything to do with the plot at all, yall just wanna jerk off to captain marvel smiling huh

My favorite part of the captain marvel trailer is when she inexplicably punches an elderly woman on the train
Dark Phoenix Captain Marvel The Lion King Wonder Woman 1984  All in 2019. And 3 of them are being scored by Hans Zimmer. I won’t survive the year. 
I don't understand this smile shit going around for Captain Marvel. She's not Superman. No one ever said anything about others not smiling, so why Carol? Wonder Woman barely ever smiled in any of the promo, so...  It's almost like there's nothing else to cling onto
My favorites are Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Captain Marvel and Black Widow 
Cannot wait to read #CaptainMarvel @79SemiFinalist  I'd read a solo Carol series regardless. But super excited to see one of my favourite Authors take the lead. And bring in one of my favourite characters #SpiderWoman
why when the captain marvel trailer dropped y’all suddenly degrading men?? you say it’s feminism but that’s,, not what feminism is.. feminism means u fight for equal rights for men & women,, sis 
My redesign of my favourite Avenger - Monica Rambeau AKA the FIRST female Captain Marvel.

5 favorite super heroes (no particular order) 1. Loki 2. Deadpool 3. Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers) 4. Nightcrawler 5. Wonder Woman
While not comic book adaptations, it's interesting that all the CAPTAIN MARVEL "we never get female heroes" talk omits YA novel adaptations ... billions in revenue from TWILIGHT, THE HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT, etc. Plenty of female heroes (super or otherwise) to go around.  
Let's go ahead and reject the inevitable media narrative that only Wonder Woman OR Captain Marvel can rock. https://tmblr.co/Zw2K3y2dhwX6G
Captain Marvel's kryptonite is being asked out? We...we need stronger female role models for little girls to look up to...

The  trailer shows a woman getting knocked down, repeatedly, only to get back up each and every single time. In the end, unleashing her inner power.  If that’s mediocre, then I guess I don't know what real power is. 
Listen @KingKyro7 Shit-head How rude of you to say asshole! Quit Pitting #GalGadot and #BrieLarson against one another. These two women are their own #WonderWoman & #CaptainMarvel both fighting for equality and human rights they are both Humanitarians something you are not!!!
A new study reveals young female fans feel more confident when they see onscreen heroes who look like them. Bring on more Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel and female Time Lords! https://cnet.co/2yrM21k
Small brain: Captain Marvel punching an "old lady" is too shocking  Large brain: Punching an "old lady" is meant to be shocking  Galaxy brain: It's misogynistic to have a female comics hero doing something a male comics hero has never  Actual brain: Hellboy did it, u fools 
White Women: Samuel L. Jackson has too many lines in the Captain Marvel trailer!!!  COME ON, MARVEL!!   Samuel L. Jackson: 
happy birthday to our one and only captain marvel, ! thank you for speaking up and standing for what you believe in. seeing such a talented and wonderful woman like you representing all of us really warms my heart. i wish you a lifetime of happiness
Rather than focusing on the fact we FINALLY have a female lead marvel film and embrace what’s to come, ppl are focusing on Nick Fury having more lines than Captain Marvel in a TRAILER!  Come on, people!

Captain Marvel is awesome. Spider Woman is better. The two together, unmissable!

someone on ig just said that captain marvel is the worst mcu character just because brie larson is a feminist does not mean that shes awful sweetie
The only one in your list that has development is Wonder Woman. You sound like such a salty bitch. No one said Captain Marvel will revolutionize female superhero films, stop reaching. Have you even seen a single Marvel movie? We need to support ALL female superheroes. 
Why comparing 'Captain Marvel' to 'Wonder Woman' or 'Black Panther' is a dangerous trap:  
She should be spider woman to Bree Larson’a Captain Marvel 
stop comparing captain marvel and wonder woman 
the captain marvel trailer was released 125 years after new zealand women finally won the right to vote  that’s incredible.

If you're still wondering why  punched an old woman in the face, the answer is very Skrully:

I’m excited for Captain Marvel... but the trailer makes it look like It’s a Green Lantern remake with a woman. Which would still be terrible.

That edit of God is a Woman over the Captain Marvel trailer is still one of my favorite things.
China has won the world teams championship, the women's world title, the women's and men's Olympiads and even a rare double gold at the same event. There is virtually only one infinity stone missing (the men's world championship) but for that one they might need a Captain Marvel. 
I got it. Male suppression is a Wonder Woman movie after they made 9 Batman movies. Male suppression is a female Captain Marvel movie after 20 marvel movies based on male heroes. Male supression is Ocean’s 8 and the female remake of ghostbusters. 
A lesson in what? Waiting 26 movies before giving a female the spotlight? Changing the female villain into a man for toy sales. You wouldn't even be getting Captain Marvel were it not for DC schooling.

Marvel literally announced Captain Marvel long before Wonder Woman was out but ok sis you can stay bitter  about this for no reason 
A new HERo will rise on International Women’s Day ‘19!  is  
Seriously dude go away with all this false negativity and even of it was true who gives a fuck. At least Captain Marvel is bringing something fresh to the MCU and is a beacon for women of all ages. Hell she has me even more excited and I've loved her character for ages. Now... 
It's still unclear to me who Captain Marvel but the way  describes her, as a woman who won't stay down, a woman who persists, has me all in. 
Captain Marvel looks fantastic and I'm glad the character is played by a woman.
I'm all about girls seeing female superheroes like Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel, but idk ... Joey Potter, Mary Camden, Lucy Camden, Lorelai Gilmore, Rory Gilmore, Buffy Summers, Summer Roberts, Haley James, Brooke Davis, Peyton Sawyer and Felicity Porter got the job done, too.
A single issue, Avengers #200, had led to feminist analysis that helped effect change in Marvel continuity.  
The news program just called Captain Marvel "Captain Woman". 
2019: female furies, ronin island, sabrina, captain marvel
The amount of people who earnestly believe Captain Marvel legit socked an old woman are a reminder that we need a new plague.
There's a reason why #CaptainMarvel will be release in the International Women's Day. It is a very powerful movie that everyone IS A MUST WATCH.
Carol Danvers and Jessica Drew go to a Halloween party. Carol, being a Star Wars geek dresses something Star Wars... and makes Jessica do the same. What do they go as?  #CaptainMarvel #SpiderWoman

 Movie on the Japanese website- “This is before the Avengers were formed. A mysterious woman descending from the skies into a video shop in LA. She was always bothered by flashbacks of memories she did not remember and she’s aiming for the secrets hidden in there..” 
Captain Marvel film in development years before Wonder Woman was being written >>>  Wonder Woman came out first >>>  I'm not gonna argue with someone who doesn't understand what was in development vs what came first.

She's going to be in the first arc of Captain Marvel for sure, which is awesome. The question should be, what are the plans for her beyond that? Bc if they don't have any ideas, I have several. #SpiderWoman
Dudebros are made at Captain Marvel being a women but just wait till they find out she’s a lesbian 
Being upset that the TRAILER for Captain Marvel, a movie with a white female lead, having a black male character with more words is white feminism at its PEAK. There are better things you can do to help women than to sit and count the number of words a character has in a preview.
2019: - spiderman: far from home - avengers 4 - captain marvel - infinity war pt 2 - wonder women 2 - suicide squad 2 - it pt 2 - star wars 9 - stranger things s3 - chaos walking  - the goldfinch   ahah can’t wait
Believe it or not, Captain Marvel is not the first female action hero. And she’s definitely not the best. 
If Captain Marvel will going to be released on national woman’s day Loki’s series will be released  on 20th of May 
We are living proof that you shouldn't pit Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel against eachother  
captain marvel, dark phoenix y wonder woman en 2019 
Stunning and brave Captain Marvel claims women live life on the defence because a guy asked her for her phone number. Another role model for female fragility. 
This is the woman y’all picked to be Captain Marvel? She can’t handle a man asking her for her phone number but she’s supposed to play one of the strongest characters in the Marvel universe? Jesus Christ  
I remember Captain Marvel being announced way before Wonder Woman had any impact lol I remember bc it got pushed back and I was so mad about it. But believe what you wanna believe
Why the fuck did Captain Marvel punch that old woman so hard? She’s a fucking super human and put some fat meat into that punch. Blasted the old bitch into another dimension for no reason
Medyo crazy at risky if next year ilabas ang Darna. Sana maganda talagang playdate. Masyadong crowded for superhero movies. Avengers 4, SpiderMan 2, Shazam, Dark Phoenix, and Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman 1984, na both girls. May Alita: Battle Angel pa.
You were responsible for some many things in my life. Marvel sparked my love of superhero’s at a very young age. From Spider-Man (every version) to Fantastic 4 to X-Men to now the Avenger and Gaurdians and Captain Marvel. You gave me strong female role models (1/3) 
While I don't want a return to the state of female characters running around in Bikinis & High Heels; performing circus contortionism as a substitute for fight moves...I DON'T necessarily like the direction now where the new Captain Marvel looks like Data from Star Trek.  2) 
 My wife is an elementary school principal and is excited to show off her  costume for her students today - the  movie featuring the first female lead in 2019. A strong female role model dressed as a strong female role model. 
50 years of history. It’s incredible to see how much  developed as a character, as a woman and a hero! Everything she went through, every adversity she overcame, made her who she is. She claimed her space as a respected leader and became Marvel’s premiere heroine! 
ok so final point, i think amatw deserved as much hype as captain marvel has been receiving (here me out) bc it introduced the first actual female superhero in her own lead film (even if scott was also the lead) and also a second female villain (especially with janet as well !)
the captain marvel hype literally lasted a week, we have to keep promoting our women and not just talk about them in the moment!!
You can be you. That means you can smile or not! BOOM   via  http://time.com/5403533/brie-larson-captain-marvel-smile/?xid=tcoshare … #WomenKickAss #CaptainMarvel @captainmarvel

Fuck   is just feminist and she was so disrespectful against stanlee's death and I won't be watching Captain marvel in cinemas also and Plzz  stop making shit movies like Captain marvel and when I saw the trailer the movie looked so lame . 
The fact that I’m so over excited about there finally being a female superhero lead movie (Captain Marvel) tells you how slowly our world, even in 2018, is progressing to the point where women are allowed to lead and make headway as individuals

Moxie has been Wonder Woman and Super Girl for Halloween so far. This year we’re doing Captain Marvel.  But where are all the kids Captain Marvel costumes???  Do we risk waiting for them to pop up?
brie thank you so much for liking my tweet. you have no idea how much you mean to me and how much captain marvel means to me. having a positive female role model out in the world is incredibly needed and i’m so glad it’s you. thank you for liking my selfies it made my whole week
I AM excited for  because it’s gonna show more female-led superhero movies are neeeded and Because Ronan the Accuser is back and he’ll likely be better developed here than he was in Guardians of the Galaxy. 
I'd love to see  give us an opportunity to see a woman hep raise up another as Carol climbs. It's just BEGGING to be done.

Captain Marvel looks really dull I feel like if the trailer was exactly the same but it stared a man instead of a woman… — it’s one of the worst cbm trailers lmfao. BUT i still think it’ll be good. just a badly edited trailer https://curiouscat.me/razaazar/post/704294253?t=1541959828 …

These days I find myself wishing more and more that we lived in a world of super heroes like Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel. We don’t so I’m eternally grateful the the every day wonder women who are trying to save us all.
My call to those to support  at the box office over International Women’s Day Weekend and it’s global run. 
I explain what it will take for Captain Marvel to become Marvel’s Wonder Woman in this week’s  column.
i just realized captain marvel comes out on international women's day 
Dear Brie Larson,  Your  is not breaking any barriers. The first solo female "Marvel" film was Elektra in 2005.  Sincerely, Marvel Fans 
Very silly.  1. Jean, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel. Arguably, some of the strongest characters is comics history.  2. Would they force girls to read comics to even the audience?  3. The ratio of male superheroes to female is almost balanced and not unfair. [use X-men as example]

Captain Marvel is the 1st MCU prequel since Cap 1, their 1st Earth character exploring space (unless u count Quill), their 1st female led movie, and the 1st entirely new character since Doctor Strange  Has a lot of new/fresh things goin for it which is why im eager/excited for it
when will sweaty nerds stop being salty about captain marvel being a woman and that brie larson is playing her? misogyny is so last century. stfu
captain marvel is making me - a woman- finally feel strong and powerful and that’s why i love her so much 
I always try to dress as an empowering female for Halloween, so this year was a no brainer- can’t wait for  to hit theaters!!  
I shouldn't be shocked that there are losers out there trying to pick fights about how the Wonder Woman film will better than the Captain Marvel film. As if there can't be two good things simultaneously. I'll never understand some people's intense desire to pick "sides." 
Disney: Hey, ABC. Can you do us a favor and make the headline suggest we gave the world the first female led superhero movie, but have the correct headline in the article, so there's plausible deniability? *hands over check*  
Yeah we need superheroes to take him down. Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel.

 and . Both their origins are tied to the Kree. Both have been part of The Avengers. Both are powerful, assertive and multidimensional women. Both should appear on a  film, together.   Please make this happen,   
So Captain Marvel is basically Man of Steel with a female lead? I wonder if critics of Zack Snyder will spit all over MARVEL for the same reasons they didn't like MOS? It's nice to see  colors accepted in Superhero films again!

2019 is the year of women. we are going to have the movie of captain marvel, dark phoenix and wonder woman, three powerful and strong female characters are going to lead those films. i love how this sounds because we are finally getting what we deserve
some people are really naive to judge that captain marvel punched an old woman and how she doesnt smiled a lot on a 1:56 minute trailer with out knowing its context oof i have to laugh

idk what's worse the wonder woman stans acting like there can only be one standalone female superhero movie out there or the black widow stans who ignore captain marvel cause their uwu natasha didn't get her standalone movie first
I think there's actually a *lot* going on with the "Captain Marvel only has one facial expression" thing, but one of the big things is: these dudes have never in their lives felt the need to learn how to read a woman's expression.
Love this show!!! So lucky to suit up as a Strong Female   
Captain Marvel was announced before Wonder Woman
Just who is Jude Law playing in ? And what exactly are the Kree? We've got all the answers you need. Here's everything you need to know about Marvel's first solo female superhero film:   
Once we get a first look at Batwoman, I wonder if the USMA will tweet about it like the USAFA did for the Captain Marvel trailer. I hope so.
who has a bigger strap: captain marvel or wonder woman. discuss
White Feminism  is getting pissy (and implying that the trailer isn't feminist/doesn't bode well for the film's feminism) because Nick Fury, a black man, has more lines in the Captain Marvel trailer than the titular character...
When I started reading comics (age 7), the only woman headlining a book was . Now/lately: , , , , ,, , , , , probably others I've missed. Nice to have so many choices.
2019 gonna bring us Dark Phoenix, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman 1984, Charlie's Angels, and Aladdin. Am I missing any? Idk but 2019 is gonna be the year of the females and I'mma be a broke bitch.

I’ve really want a Captain Marvel/Wonder Woman crossover so I decided to do something a little different & make my own plus add a Wayhaught twist (because I can!)    FanArt    Do NOT repost or steal.
Just finished my first draft of my proposal for my dissertation. Main focuses are the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how they write female characters from 2008-present, Captain Marvel and her place within Marvel and lastly how fans receive her character! Super excited!
every time I see wonder woman merch I think it’s captain marvel smh
All 3 of these Marvel 2019 movies could surpass $1 billion at the box-office.   Captain Marvel is the 1st female lead MCU movie. Avengers 4 is the follow-up to Infinity War. Spider-Man: Far From Home includes the title character, who's very popular.   Marvel just does not stop.
